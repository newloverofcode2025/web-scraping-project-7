🕸️ **Web Scraping Project 7: Job Listings Scraper** 🕸️

🚀 **Overview**
Welcome to the seventh project in our web scraping series! 🎉 This project takes web scraping to the next level by extracting detailed job listings from a job board and saving the data to a CSV file. We'll scrape job details, including titles, companies, locations, descriptions, and posting dates, and handle pagination to scrape multiple pages. Additionally, we'll generate a bar chart to visualize the top locations with the most job listings. This project is perfect for those looking to deepen their web scraping skills and work with data visualization.

📂 **Project Structure**
Here’s how the project is organized:
Copy
web-scraping-project-7/
├── src/
│   └── main.py
├── data/
│   └── jobs.csv
├── plots/
│   └── job_count_by_location.png
└── README.md
src/: Contains the Python script (main.py) that performs the web scraping.
data/: Stores the output CSV file (jobs.csv) containing the scraped data.
plots/: Stores the generated bar chart (job_count_by_location.png).
README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

📚 **Dependencies**
To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:
requests: For making HTTP requests to the website.
beautifulsoup4: For parsing HTML content.
pandas: For data manipulation and saving to CSV.
matplotlib: For generating bar charts.
You can install these dependencies using pip:
bashCopy
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas matplotlib

🛠️ **Setup**
Follow these steps to get started:
Clone the Repository:
bashCopy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-scraping-project-7.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:
bashCopy
cd web-scraping-project-7
Install Dependencies:
bashCopy
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas matplotlib
Run the Script:
bashCopy
python src/main.py

🎯 **Usage**
The script main.py performs the following steps:
Fetches the Website Content:
Sends an HTTP GET request to the specified URL.
Parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup.
Extracts Relevant Data:
Extracts job details such as titles, companies, locations, descriptions, and posting dates from the HTML.
Handles Pagination:
Scrapes multiple pages to collect a comprehensive dataset.
Saves Data to CSV:
Uses pandas to save the extracted data to a CSV file (data/jobs.csv).
Generates Bar Chart:
Uses matplotlib to generate a bar chart showing the top 10 locations with the most job listings.
Saves the bar chart to plots/job_count_by_location.png.

🎯 **Example**
To run the script, simply execute the following command in your terminal:
bashCopy
python src/main.py
This will scrape the specified job board and save the extracted data to data/jobs.csv. It will also generate a bar chart and save it to plots/job_count_by_location.png.

📝 **Notes**
URL Modification: You can modify the URL in main.py to scrape different job boards.
Data Extraction: Customize the data extraction logic in main.py to scrape different elements from the job board.
Permissions: Ensure you have permission to scrape the website and comply with its robots.txt file.
Visualization: The script includes logic to generate a bar chart for data visualization.
