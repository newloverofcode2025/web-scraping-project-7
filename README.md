# Web Scraping Project 7

## Overview
This project demonstrates a web scraping task using Python, requests, and BeautifulSoup. It scrapes job listings from a job board, including job titles, company names, locations, job descriptions, and posting dates. The script saves the data to a CSV file and generates a bar chart showing the top 10 locations with the most job listings.
